        <h1>Our Donation Plan</h1>
        <p>Donars want to know about our strategy of donation. <br>We usually work on three different sections
            so that every amount will help one.</p>

                <h2>Food for family</h2>
                <p>Since the COVID-19 arrived, there are so many families that undergo some unbearable circumstances
                    such as lack of foods. We will provide them foods for one-month from the donation we receive . In
                    every month, we provide food for 1000+ families.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Shelter for a family</h2>
                <p>Because of the flood situation, more than 20,000+ families lost their home. They don't have a place
                    to live. Our fund has already started working on it. We already made more than 1000+ houses for
                    those who have been effected by the floods.</p>

                <h2>Education for a child</h2>
                <p>The life of an orphan is very miserable. Like other children, they don't get much opportunity to
                    study. But we don't want to let them fall. To develop their educational career, our foundation works
                    on 5-17 years old orphans with the help of the donation we receive from donars.</p>
